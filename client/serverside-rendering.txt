me  - request to the URL from browser -> localhost:3000
//this makes a request to the next.js "server" or router
-> next.js server
//then next.js server makes a request to graphql server
-> graphql server localhost:4000
-> HTML is built on the server (if ssr is true) 
-> and sending back to the client browser


** next.js will switch between server side rendering and client side rendering 
- if loading a page set for serverside rendering as a direct URL request from the browser, HTML is built by server and sent to client 
- but if the page set for ssr is navigated to by the client side routing, then the page is client side rendered 
  * i.e. navigating BACK from login page to the home page via client side routing, 
    home page will client side render and make graphql requests from the client (since we already loaded the SPA once it will resort to client side rendering)
    - if the page was navigated to by requesting the URL directly or refreshing (if not loading from the browser cache) 
      the page will serverside render (if ssr is set true for that component)

      the urql client is responsible for telling the graphql server to render the components' HTML on the server and if there
      is data needed to be queried that will change the page dynamically this can be rendered on the server via the urql graphql client


next js server (dev server) does not operate on a cookie
